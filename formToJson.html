  the user enters data in an HTML form,
  clicks a link (anchor element),
  our jquery creates a json object representing the form data,
  the browser opens a standard OS save file dialog,
  the json object is saved as a string in the file
  
  we could then use the JSON string in the file to update a database
  
  depending on the database system, we may need some JSON to XML middleware, which is already out there
  i'm just not already familiar with any particular tool

  we could also write code here to create the properly formatted XML
  as the output too... but who in tf wants to do that???
  
  there also may be existing XML generator libraries to use here, but i'm unaware of any
  
  so there's two todos:
  
  TODO: json-to-xml tool and javascript-based XML generator

  we use jQuery here  
  the code is at the end of this file
  vanilla javascript is in another file in this repo (eventually)
  
  dependencies: html5 for the download attribute of the anchor element
-->

<html><head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<form id='form'>
<label for='k1'>key1: </label>
<input id='k1' name='k1' type='text'>
<br>
<label for='k2'>key2: </label>
<input id='k2' name='k2' type='text'>
</form>
<br>
<a id='save'>save form data as a json string on local filesystem</a>

<!------------------
  our jquery code
-------------------->
<script>

// a reference to the anchor element
saveAnchor = $('#save')

// use the html5 attribute download on the anchor

// the second argument is the suggested file name
// that the save file dialog will suggest

// of course, we could set it programmaticay,
// for example based on some of the form's field values

saveAnchor.attr('download', 'ourJsonFile.json');

// the anchor elements click event listener
saveAnchor.on('click', () =>
{
  // serializeArray() takes the form element
  // and returns an array of javascript objects

  // each member in the array is a javascript object representing
  // one of the fields in the form

  // if the user entered 'v1' for the k1 field
  // and 'v2' for the k2 field,
  // serializeArry() returns
  /*
      [
        {name: 'k1', value: 'v1'},
        {name: 'k2', value: 'v2'}
      ]
  */

  // but we want a javascript object like this:
  /*
    {
      'k1': 'v1',
      'k2': 'v2'
    }
  */

  // the javascript object we'll make from the serializeArray() array
  var formJSObject = {}

  // ue the each() method to loop through the serializeArray() array

  // the first argument is the array
  // the second argument is the function to apply to the current member of the array

  // i is the index of the array, which we don't need use here
  // field is the current member of the array,
  //    which in our case is the javascript object that represents one of the input elements in the form
  //    see lines 72 to 75.

  $.each($('#form').serializeArray(), (i, field) => { formJSObject[field.name] = field.value; })

  // now, formJSObject should look like the javascript object in lines 80 to 83

  // set the anchor's href value to use the data: scheme
  // as plain text data using utf-8 encoding
  // i tried using data:application/json, but it didn't work, not sure why

  saveAnchor.attr(
      "href",
      "data:text/plain;charset=utf-8," // now we need to attach the JSON object as the data
      + JSON.stringify(formJSObject));
  // we may need to use encodeURIComponent to handle special characters,
  // but we'll leave it out for now, it's ok for simple data
}); // end of saveAnchor's click event Listener
